> **Let’s stop profiting from war: A proposal to remove weapons companies from the stock market**

## ✨ Introduction

How many of us are truly tired of war? Tired of lost dreams, of hopes buried under rubble, of children crying in the dust of destroyed homes?

I am. And I want to say, *enough is enough* — in the most respectful, peaceful, and legal way possible.

I’m just an ordinary person who feels that we have been used by a global system that profits from conflict. This document presents a practical, ethical proposal to reduce the incentive for war by removing its profit motive.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

1. **Profit from Bloodshed:** Many weapons manufacturers are publicly traded. Their stock values and dividends often rise when conflicts escalate, meaning ordinary investors make passive income from destruction.
2. **Structural Moral Failure:** When death becomes profitable, peace loses its value as a goal. The longer wars last, the more money flows into these portfolios.
3. **Accountability Gap:** Private shareholders face no ethical constraints, while defense remains controlled through market speculation rather than democratic oversight.

## 💡 Proposal

1. **Delisting Military Divisions:** Make it illegal for individuals or private funds to invest in the military divisions of arms companies. These divisions must be delisted from all public stock exchanges.
2. **Government-Only Ownership:** Limit investment in arms manufacturing to national governments, under full transparency and accountability appropriate to each country's system of governance — whether democratic, monarchical, or otherwise — as long as it ensures ethical control over arms trade and full transparency.
3. **Separate Civilian Operations:** Allow civilian branches (aviation, research, logistics) to remain publicly tradable.

This removes the financial incentive to prolong or provoke war without banning defense capabilities.

## 🎯 Campaign Objective

## 🌍 Impact on Emerging Nations

This proposal is not just about protecting the world from future wars — it’s also about empowering emerging nations and helping them escape the cycle of dependency and militarized politics.

1. **Lowering the Arms Race Pressure:** Developing countries often feel pressured to match military spending fueled by private investments in richer nations. Removing the profit motive can ease that pressure.
2. **Freeing Budget for Human Development:** Instead of allocating scarce resources to weapon imports, nations could invest in healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
3. **Supporting Indigenous Defense Industries:** Countries that wish to build their own ethical, transparent defense sectors can do so without competing against publicly-traded military giants.
4. **Leveling the Diplomatic Field:** With greater transparency in arms trade, smaller nations can negotiate international agreements on clearer and more just terms.

This campaign is also a call for equity — so that peace isn't just a privilege of the powerful, but a shared global standard.

The purpose of this campaign is to find and support a **government** willing to officially adopt and champion this proposal:

* **Propose** an international legal initiative to remove military arms industries from public markets.
* **Advocate** for binding restrictions preventing individuals from profiting from war.
* **Submit** motions in international courts or diplomatic forums on behalf of the world’s citizens.

Only with a governmental sponsor can this idea move from grassroots to global policy.

## 💸 Theoretical Funding Concept (Not a Donation Request)

This is not a fundraiser, and I am not collecting donations.I do not intend to manage or launch any funding campaign myself.

The following is merely a theoretical model to show how global citizens could, in principle, support this idea if it were ever taken seriously by legal professionals or international organizations:

> A grassroots fundraiser (e.g., via GoFundMe or similar) could be launched in the future, not by me personally, but by a recognized and transparent third party.
> 
> Its aim would be to fund an **international human rights legal team**, or to empower a **respected NGO** to advocate for this initiative in international law forums or courts.
> 
> The purpose would be to **represent global citizens**, not specific governments, in drafting and submitting new legal standards that prohibit private profiteering from warfare.

This vision assumes full transparency, independent oversight, and strict legal compliance and it remains just that: a vision.

## 🧠 Criticism & My Response

> “International law isn’t meant for this kind of issue.”

I’m not a lawyer, but I believe:

* **International law exists to protect the weak.** If not for that, whom does it protect?
* **Laws evolve with society.** Judges and lawmakers must adapt to new moral awareness, ensuring that powerful actors face constraints before the vulnerable suffer.
* **Justice demands ambition.** Drafting new legal principles to restrain the powerful is not impossible, it's necessary.



> “There is a fundamental issue with this.
>
> The people in Congress are the only ones, maybe the President with EO, who can set these rules. These are the same people who benefit from early warnings and policies for war.
>
> So if they are making bank, what reason do you have to convince them to make less money? And don't bother with ethics or humanity. They have been profiting off of this for a while now. Your argument won't convince them differently.”

That's a valid point, and I don't deny the conflict of interest within many governments, including Congress.

But my proposal isn't about expecting the same individuals who profit from war to suddenly grow a conscience, it's about creating pressure through international humanitarian law.

The goal is to make this a **global legal standard**, not just a national policy. If codified into international law similar to bans on chemical weapons or child soldiers this kind of restriction could transcend individual governments and become part of the legal fabric nations are expected to follow.

Implementation wouldn't be overnight. A law like this would likely come with a transition period to allow markets and companies to adjust.

And just like with other violations of international humanitarian law, countries that refuse to comply could face global consequences: diplomatic pressure, sanctions, or reputational damage. It's not about moral appeals it's about real enforceable structures that shift the cost-benefit balance away from war profiteering.


> “How about cigarette companies, or alcohol companies, or gun companies, or car companies? You could argue that all of them are profiting off death.
> Plus, privately owned defense contractors still means that individuals are profitting off war. Hell, even just having individuals working to develop and manufacture weapons means they're profitting from war.”

I'd say that when someone smokes or drinks, they are at least making a personal choice. It's a form of self-inflicted harm.
But in war, the people dying never consented. Civilians don't sign up to be bombed. It's harm inflicted on others often the most vulnerable *without their will or involvement*.

To be clear, I’m not excusing other harmful industries. In fact, I believe many of them like tobacco or alcohol  *do* profit off long-term death and suffering.
But the difference is in urgency and agency. War kills directly, indiscriminately, and without the victim’s choice.

Also, to answer the "Plus" part: How much moral responsibility does an individual bear when they are part of a system that produces harm but they themselves have no real control over the outcomes?

That's why I think it's crucial to draw a distinction between:

* Those who survive within a system, and
* Those who profit passively from the continuation of that harm, without suffering its consequences.

One is a cog in the machine.
The other owns the machine and earns when it kills.

The aim of my proposal is to target the latter, not the former.

## 🙋 Closing Thought

If this document made you laugh or dismiss me, I’m okay with that — even glad if it brought a smile. But ask yourself:

> *What if ordinary people actually said “NO” to the profit-driven war machine?*
> *What if we told politicians and capitalists: “You work for us, not the other way around”?*

Wouldn’t you want to leave a better world for your children and grandchildren?

**If planting this idea costs me a few laughs, I’ll gladly pay.**
Have a nice day. 🍉
