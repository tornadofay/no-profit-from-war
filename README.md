> **Let’s stop profiting from war: A proposal to remove weapons companies from the stock market**

## ✨ Introduction

How many of us are truly tired of war? Tired of lost dreams, of hopes buried under rubble, of children crying in the dust of destroyed homes?

I am. And I want to say, *enough is enough* — in the most respectful, peaceful, and legal way possible.

I’m just an ordinary person who feels that we have been used by a global system that profits from conflict. This document presents a practical, ethical proposal to reduce the incentive for war by removing its profit motive.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

1. **Profit from Bloodshed:** Many weapons manufacturers are publicly traded. Their stock values and dividends often rise when conflicts escalate, meaning ordinary investors make passive income from destruction.
2. **Structural Moral Failure:** When death becomes profitable, peace loses its value as a goal. The longer wars last, the more money flows into these portfolios.
3. **Accountability Gap:** Private shareholders face no ethical constraints, while defense remains controlled through market speculation rather than democratic oversight.

## 💡 Proposal

1. **Delisting Military Divisions:** Make it illegal for individuals or private funds to invest in the military divisions of arms companies. These divisions must be delisted from all public stock exchanges.
2. **Government-Only Ownership:** Limit investment in arms manufacturing to national governments, under full transparency and accountability appropriate to each country's system of governance — whether democratic, monarchical, or otherwise — as long as it ensures ethical control over arms trade and full transparency.
3. **Separate Civilian Operations:** Allow civilian branches (aviation, research, logistics) to remain publicly tradable.

This removes the financial incentive to prolong or provoke war without banning defense capabilities.

## 🎯 Campaign Objective

## 🌍 Impact on Emerging Nations

This proposal is not just about protecting the world from future wars — it’s also about empowering emerging nations and helping them escape the cycle of dependency and militarized politics.

1. **Lowering the Arms Race Pressure:** Developing countries often feel pressured to match military spending fueled by private investments in richer nations. Removing the profit motive can ease that pressure.
2. **Freeing Budget for Human Development:** Instead of allocating scarce resources to weapon imports, nations could invest in healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
3. **Supporting Indigenous Defense Industries:** Countries that wish to build their own ethical, transparent defense sectors can do so without competing against publicly-traded military giants.
4. **Leveling the Diplomatic Field:** With greater transparency in arms trade, smaller nations can negotiate international agreements on clearer and more just terms.

This campaign is also a call for equity — so that peace isn't just a privilege of the powerful, but a shared global standard.

The purpose of this campaign is to find and support a **government** willing to officially adopt and champion this proposal:

* **Propose** an international legal initiative to remove military arms industries from public markets.
* **Advocate** for binding restrictions preventing individuals from profiting from war.
* **Submit** motions in international courts or diplomatic forums on behalf of the world’s citizens.

Only with a governmental sponsor can this idea move from grassroots to global policy.

## 💸 Fundraiser Plan

I have no bank account, nor do I want one. But I envision:

> Launching a public fundraiser (GoFundMe or similar) to raise donations from ordinary people.
> The goal: to fund the hiring of an **international human rights lawyer** or to partner with a respected **NGO**.
> They will act on behalf of the people — not governments — to submit legal motions or draft new international law restricting private arms investments.

---

## 🧠 Anticipating Criticism & My Response

> “International law isn’t meant for this kind of issue.”

I’m not a lawyer, but I believe:

* **International law exists to protect the weak.** If not for that, whom does it protect?
* **Laws evolve with society.** Judges and lawmakers must adapt to new moral awareness, ensuring that powerful actors face constraints before the vulnerable suffer.
* **Justice demands ambition.** Drafting new legal principles to restrain the powerful is not impossible — it’s necessary.

## 🙋 Closing Thought

If this document made you laugh or dismiss me, I’m okay with that — even glad if it brought a smile. But ask yourself:

> *What if ordinary people actually said “NO” to the profit-driven war machine?*
> *What if we told politicians and capitalists: “You work for us, not the other way around”?*

Wouldn’t you want to leave a better world for your children and grandchildren?

**If planting this idea costs me a few laughs, I’ll gladly pay.**
Have a nice day. 🍉
