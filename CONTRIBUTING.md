# Contributing to Demilitarize the Markets

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this important initiative! We welcome help from everyone who shares our vision of a world where peace is more profitable than war.

This document provides guidelines for how you can contribute effectively.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, and not all of them require technical skills.

### 1. Refining the Proposal

The core of this project is the proposal itself. You can help by:

*   **Suggesting Edits:** If you have expertise in international law, finance, or policy, your insights are invaluable. Please suggest improvements by opening a GitHub Issue or submitting a Pull Request.
*   **Providing Feedback:** Even without a specific edit in mind, you can open an Issue to discuss parts of the proposal that are unclear, weak, or could be improved.

### 2. Research and Data Gathering

The proposal must be backed by strong evidence. You can help by:

*   **Finding Data:** Look for up-to-date statistics, reports, and financial data that support the arguments in the proposal. Share your findings in an Issue.
*   **Identifying Case Studies:** Research historical or ongoing campaigns that can serve as precedents or models (e.g., divestment campaigns, international treaties).
*   **Using the AI Research Hub:** If you have experience with LLMs or scripting, you can help automate research by using and improving the prompts in the `research_automation/` directory.

### 3. Translation and Localization

To reach a global audience, we need to translate the proposal into many languages.

*   **Translating:** If you are fluent in another language, you can help translate the `README.md` and other key documents. Please see our [Translation Guide](#translation-guide) below for instructions.
*   **Reviewing Translations:** You can also help by reviewing existing translations for accuracy and clarity.

### 4. Spreading the Word

*   **Share the proposal:** Share the link to this GitHub repository on social media, with colleagues, or with relevant organizations.
*   **Start a discussion:** Talk about this idea in your community, online forums, or with your local representatives.

## Submission Guidelines

### Opening Issues

Use GitHub Issues to report problems, suggest improvements, or discuss ideas. Please check if a similar issue already exists before creating a new one.

### Submitting Pull Requests

If you want to make a direct change to a file, please submit a Pull Request (PR).

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your changes.
3.  Make your changes and commit them with a clear, descriptive message.
4.  Push your branch and open a Pull Request.
5.  In the PR description, please explain the "what" and "why" of your changes.

## Translation Guide

We manage translations in a simple way to keep things accessible.

1.  **Check for existing translations:** Look for a folder named `translations/` in the repository. Inside, see if a file for your language already exists (e.g., `README.es.md` for Spanish).
2.  **Start a new translation:** If your language is not there, you can start a new one. Create a new file in the `translations/` directory named `README.xx.md` where `xx` is the two-letter ISO 639-1 code for your language.
3.  **Translate the content:** Copy the content from the main `README.md` and translate it.
4.  **Submit your translation:** Create a Pull Request with your new translation file.
