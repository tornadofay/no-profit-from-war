# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the "Demilitarize the Markets" initiative. Our goal is to evolve this proposal from a manifesto into a robust, data-driven, and actionable plan ready for engagement with policymakers, legal experts, and the international community.

This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as the project progresses. Community contributions and suggestions are welcome.

## Phase 1: Strengthening the Core Proposal (In Progress)

The immediate priority is to enhance the core proposal to make it more rigorous and suitable for a formal, legal audience.

*   **[ ] Restructure the Proposal:** Reformat the main document to align with standards for policy papers. This includes adding an Executive Summary, a detailed legal framework, and a practical implementation plan.
*   **[ ] Integrate Data and Evidence:** Incorporate statistics, economic data, and historical precedents to support the proposal's arguments. (See Phase 2).
*   **[ ] Refine Arguments under International Law:** Clearly articulate the proposal's basis within existing principles of International Humanitarian Law (IHL).

## Phase 2: Data and Research

To build a compelling case, we need to be data-driven. This phase focuses on gathering and integrating evidence.

*   **[ ] Initial Research:** Conduct foundational research to find supporting data, case studies of similar campaigns (e.g., fossil fuel divestment), and reports from recognized institutions like SIPRI.
*   **[ ] Establish an AI Research Hub:** Create a dedicated repository (`/research_automation`) with instructions for AI agents to perform continuous, automated research. This will ensure our data remains current.

## Phase 3: Community Building and Outreach

A global problem requires a global community. This phase focuses on building a network of supporters and contributors.

*   **[ ] Create Contribution Guidelines:** Establish a `CONTRIBUTING.md` to provide clear instructions for how people can help with research, translation, and advocacy.
*   **[ ] Develop a Translation Framework:** Set up a system to translate the proposal into multiple languages to maximize its global reach. We will prioritize languages based on community interest and strategic importance.
*   **[ ] Launch Community Forum:** Set up a space for discussion, such as GitHub Discussions, to allow supporters to connect, share ideas, and coordinate efforts.

## Phase 4: Advocacy and Engagement

Once the proposal is sufficiently strengthened and supported by a community, we will move to active advocacy.

*   **[ ] Identify Target Governments and NGOs:** Research and identify potential state sponsors or partner organizations who may be willing to champion this proposal.
*   **[ ] Develop Advocacy Materials:** Create a toolkit for supporters, including letter templates, social media content, and presentation slides.
*   **[ ] Direct Outreach:** Begin targeted outreach to policymakers, journalists, and influential figures in the legal and human rights communities.
